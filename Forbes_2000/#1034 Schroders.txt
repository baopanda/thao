Federal National Mortgage Association is a government-sponsored company. It provides liquidity, stability and affordability to the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and its activities include providing market liquidity by securitizing mortgage loans originated by lenders in the primary mortgage market into Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities and purchasing mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities in the secondary market. The company operates through three segments: Single-Family Credit Guaranty, Multifamily, andRead More Capital Markets. The Single-Family segment generates revenue primarily from the guaranty fees on the mortgage loans underlying guaranteed single-family Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities. The Multifamily segment generates revenue from a variety of sources, including guaranty fees on the mortgage loans underlying multifamily Fannie Mae MBS and on the multifamily mortgage loans held in its portfolio, transaction fees associated with the multifamily business and bond credit enhancement fees. The Capital Markets segment invests in mortgage loans, mortgage-related securities and other investments, and generates income primarily from the difference, or spread, between the yields on the mortgage assets it owns and the interest paid on the debt the company issued in the global capital markets to fund the purchases of these mortgage assets. The company was founded in 1938 and is headquartered in Washington, DC.
