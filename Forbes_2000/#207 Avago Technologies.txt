The company makes its second appearance on the list in a row, thanks to a share price that nearly doubled over the past year and sales that jumped by almost 70% in 2014. Net profits, however, fell 52% due to higher income taxes. It unveiled a blockbuster deal in May when it announced it was buying a much-bigger rival, U.S.-based Broadcom, for $37 billion. Broadcom’s revenue was nearly double Avago’s last year. Deal is set to close in early 2016.
